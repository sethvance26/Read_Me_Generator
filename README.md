## Description
A command-line application using Inquirer & accessed through Node.js that dynamically creates a README file based off a User's input.

This week, we were tasked with creating a high-quality README generator that included what the app was for,
 how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions. We also had 
 to include a Screencastify video demonstrating how the application works. You can see that here. 

I accomplished this by building an array of questions, using inquirer to prompt the user, and then writing functions and using fs to get 
that information to write into a new README file. The entire application is ran using Node.js
